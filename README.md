### Project Name:
# vibration

### Project Brief Description:
The main idea of our project is the AI model will generate interactive painting integrated with Arduino connected with sensors of temperature, humidity, percentage of light and water, and according to the sensors results, if the plants conditions satisfied the long-wavelength vibrations, then the painting will re-color by (blue, green and violet), otherwise (red, yellow and orange)

### Project AI Description:
We train a ML model that can draw a painting of any living creature and its color depending on the sensors results that comes form the Arduino, if satisfied or not.

### Project Art Description:
The Interactive AI art is represented in the presence of low amount of light, low temperature, high water content, and high humidity, where short wavelength vibrations of blue, green and violet are formed in the painting. If the amount of light is high, the temperature is high, the humidity is low, and the water percentage is low, long-wavelength vibrations of red, yellow and orange are formed in the plastic painting.
